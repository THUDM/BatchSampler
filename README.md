<h1> BatchSampler: Sampling Mini-Batches for Contrastive Learning in Vision, Language, and Graphs </h1>



Source code for KDD'23 paper:  [BatchSampler: Sampling Mini-Batches for Contrastive Learning in Vision, Language, and Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03355).


BatchSampler is a simple and general generative method to sample mini-batches of hard-to-distinguish (i.e., hard and true negatives to each other) instances, which can be directly plugged into in-batch contrastive models in vision, language, and graphs. 

<h2>Dependencies </h2>
